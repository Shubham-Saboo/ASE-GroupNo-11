**Paragraph describing the observed explanation tax? i.e. explanations often mean simplifying complex ideas and some explanations do not capture all the details of the data. Which means sometimes, the conclusions we make via explanations can be worse that if we reasoned from the instances.**<br>
The "explanation tax" is like the price we pay for making things easier to understand. When we break down really complicated ideas into something simpler, it's like we're trying to fit a vast landscape into a small photograph. Sure, it helps us get the gist, but in doing so, we end up missing out on a lot of the details that make the full picture so rich and informative. It's a bit of a double-edged sword because on one hand, simplifying complex data or theories lets us wrap our heads around them and share them with others more easily. But on the flip side, this streamlined version might not always do justice to the original complexity, leading us to conclusions or decisions that might not be as solid as if we'd grappled with the nitty-gritty details from the start. So, while explanations help us navigate through dense information jungles, they also remind us to be mindful of what might be left unseen in the shadows of simplicity.
