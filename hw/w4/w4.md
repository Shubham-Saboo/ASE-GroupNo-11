1. **Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?**   
Yes. We are trying to minimize 1st term and maximize 2nd, 3rd terms in each row. Prints 1, 2, and 4 mostly run in the range of [2800-4300, 13-17, 20-30] while 5 has values around [2300-2600, 16-17, 27-31] and 6 has values around [1600-3200, 14-22, 20-40]. Although the range of values in print 6 varies more, one/two of the three values are closest to heaven, making it one of the best rows seen in the iteration.

2. **How many y-row evaluations are required for print 3?**   
To find the best y value, we need to look through all rows to find one with the least d2h. Hence, the evaluations required are equal to the number of total rows, 398.

3. **How does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)**    
The absolute best is [2130, 24.6, 40] which is reasonably close to print 5 (average best) with values around [2300-2600, 16-17, 27-31] and print 6 (optimal best), which takes the worse values ([>2500, <17, <30]) rarely. Print 5 generalizes better without too much variance.
